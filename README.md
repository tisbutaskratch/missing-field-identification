# missing-field-identification

How I approached the problem:
1) Understand requirements
2) Create models based on data definition.
3) Create test for Policy class as an example of getters and setters testing.
4) Create a class to store required fields per insurance
5) Create functions for each required field
6) 

Nitpicks:
1) Make type enum if we knew all Address types in advance
2) Camelcase sec_unit_* variables in Address class
3) 

What I could have done better:
1) More testing for getters and setters.
2)
